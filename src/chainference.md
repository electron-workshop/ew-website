# Chainference

## A simple idea for stronger, more connected conferences

In our ecosystem, conferences often happen in isolation.

While events may focus on different topics or communities, the people who attend them—speakers, volunteers, organisers, and participants—overlap significantly. Despite this strong correlation, each conference typically runs its **before**, **during**, and **after** phases on its own.

This creates friction:
- Calls for papers and ideas start from scratch every time
- Volunteer discovery is repetitive and time‑consuming
- Post‑conference follow‑ups are uneven or missing
- Valuable energy and momentum are lost between events

Some conferences try to address these challenges, but doing so individually is hard, resource‑intensive, and not yet the norm—so it is rarely expected.

## The notion of a Chainference

**Chainference** is our name for a collective, ecosystem‑level layer that exists *alongside* conferences.

It is not a replacement for conferences, and it does not interfere with the autonomy or responsibilities of individual organisers.

Instead, a Chainference:
- Operates at a **meta level**, across multiple conferences
- Is initiated and sustained by the **ecosystem**, not a single event
- Makes conference organisation **lighter and easier**, not heavier

You can think of it as a shared connective tissue between otherwise separate events.

## What a Chainference does

A Chainference focuses on the stages around a conference that benefit most from collective effort:

### Before conferences
- Supporting **calls for papers** and session ideas
- Creating shared spaces for **grassroots ideation**
- Helping speakers shape and refine proposals

### Around conferences
- Encouraging cross‑conference participation and awareness
- Strengthening relationships between communities

### After conferences
- Facilitating **post‑conference engagement**
- Creating opportunities to reflect, learn, and continue conversations
- Helping recordings and ideas reach wider audiences

## Why this must be collective

Some things cannot be done effectively by a single conference—no matter how well‑resourced it is.

These activities are collective by nature:
- Sustained community learning
- Cross‑pollination of ideas between events
- Long‑term volunteer and speaker discovery
- Cultural continuity across conferences

Chainference exists specifically to enable this kind of collective action.

## What we have done so far

As part of the Chainference approach, we have already begun with two practical initiatives:

### Grassroots ideation for Calls for Papers
We facilitate open ideation sessions where community members:
- Explore themes together
- Develop session ideas collaboratively
- Lower the barrier to becoming a speaker

These sessions help conferences receive stronger, more diverse proposals—without increasing organiser workload.

### Conference watch parties
We organise watch parties for **publicly available conference recordings** that matter to the collective.

These events:
- Create shared learning moments
- Re‑activate conference content after the event ends
- Bring people together who may not have attended the original conference

## In summary

**Chainference** is our term for a shared, ecosystem‑driven layer that connects conferences across time and community.

It helps with what happens *before* and *after* conferences, supports organisers rather than burdening them, and enables collective efforts that no single event can achieve alone.

It is not an event.
It is not a brand.

It is a practice—and a commitment—to building conferences as part of a living, connected ecosystem.
