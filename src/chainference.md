# Chainference

## A collaborative layer that strengthens conferences

Chainference is a simple idea born from respect for conferences and the people who organise them.

In our ecosystem, conferences are thoughtfully designed, carefully delivered, and deeply valued. Each event has its own identity, goals, culture, and constraints—and organisers already carry a significant responsibility in bringing them to life.

At the same time, we observe a shared reality:
- The people who attend, speak at, volunteer for, and organise conferences overlap significantly
- Engagement naturally begins *before* a conference and often wants to continue *after* it
- Some opportunities for connection and value exist beyond the scope of any single event

Chainference exists to support this reality—not to critique it.

## What we mean by Chainference

**Chainference** is our name for a voluntary, ecosystem‑initiated layer that sits *alongside* conferences.

It is designed to:
- **Align with conference organisers**, not direct or override them
- **Respect full ownership** of conference design, content, delivery, and intellectual property
- **Reduce effort**, not add complexity
- **Increase value for audiences**, speakers, and volunteers

Chainference does not replace existing processes, brands, or decisions. It complements them.

## Clear boundaries, by design

From the outset, Chainference is intentionally scoped to avoid grey areas.

We do **not**:
- Make decisions about conference programs
- Influence acceptance or rejection of talks
- Control messaging, branding, or delivery
- Use or redistribute non‑public materials
- Claim ownership over ideas, content, or outcomes

Conference organisers retain full control and IP at all times.

Our role is supportive, optional, and transparent.

## Where Chainference helps most

Chainference focuses on areas where collective effort can add value *without interfering* with organiser workflows.

### Before conferences
- Facilitating **grassroots ideation spaces** that help potential speakers explore themes and shape ideas
- Supporting **call‑for‑papers readiness** by lowering barriers to participation
- Helping organisers reach engaged, prepared contributors

### Around conferences
- Encouraging cross‑community awareness and participation
- Strengthening relationships between aligned events and audiences

### After conferences
- Creating opt‑in spaces for **post‑conference reflection and learning**
- Supporting continued engagement around publicly available content
- Helping conference impact extend beyond event dates

All participation is voluntary and aligned with organiser intent.

## Why this works best at an ecosystem level

Some forms of value are inherently collective:
- Long‑term speaker development
- Volunteer discovery across events
- Knowledge continuity between conferences
- Community momentum that spans years, not days

These are difficult for any single conference to sustain alone—even with strong resources.

Chainference exists to hold this shared layer, so conferences can focus on what they do best.

## What we have done so far

We are intentionally starting small and responsibly.

### Grassroots ideation for Calls for Papers
We facilitate open, community‑driven ideation sessions where participants:
- Explore conference themes together
- Develop early‑stage session ideas
- Gain confidence and clarity before submitting proposals

This often results in stronger, more thoughtful submissions—without adding work for organisers.

### Conference watch parties
We organise watch parties around **publicly available conference recordings** that matter to the collective.

These events:
- Extend the life of conference content
- Create shared learning experiences
- Introduce conferences to new audiences respectfully

We only work with content that organisers have already chosen to make public.

## An open invitation

Chainference is an invitation, not an obligation.

If you organise a conference and:
- Care about your community beyond event dates
- Want to increase the impact of your call for papers
- Are curious about collective approaches that respect your autonomy

We would love to explore how Chainference can support *your* goals.

Our intention is simple:

> **Help conferences create more value for their audiences—together—while staying fully in your control.**

Chainference is not an event.
It is not a brand overlay.

It is a shared practice for a healthier conference ecosystem.
